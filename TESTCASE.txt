Advisor:

Case 30: try print time table for 2015-04-10: not ok (also print 2015-05-03 12:00:00 Group:0/5)

Case 31: after a student maade an appoinment, try print time table: not ok (print time table not update
	(same as before the student made an appoinment))

Case 32: add a new time, green color time table updated: ok

Case 33: after student sign up, green time table update: ok

Case 34: after student sign up, without clicking "print time time table", 
	update the every day time table: ok

That all I can think of, I am sorry that I cannot deliver my promise that I will make about 60 cases, but I have 
tested all the functions, both Advisor and Student, and make sure all the required fuctions work properly.
In case the developer have MADE ANY CHANGE to the old fucntions that I have tested, he need to tell ASAP me so that
I will test all the old cases AGAIN.
